> ?mpg
# to learn more about mpg data and its variables

ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy))
#the plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (displ) and fuel efficiency (hwy). 
#In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel.

3.2.4 Exercises
#Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
#nothing

#How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?
#234 rows and 11 columns

#What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out
#drv
f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd

#Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.
ggplot(data=mpg)+
+ geom_point(mapping=aes(x=hwy,y=cyl))
#hwy= highway miles per gallon and #cyl=number of cylinders
no real correlation. more miles will use cylinders

#What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=class,y=drv))
#does not show any correlation

3.3 Aesthetic mappings 

COLOR
ggplot(data=mpg)+
+ geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, color=class))
#different class vehicles are mapped to different colours
# Scaling: ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic (here a unique color) 
to each unique value of the variable, a process known as scaling.

SIZE
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,size=class))
#Warning message:
#Using size for a discrete variable is not advised. 
#because mapping an unordered variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size) is not a good idea.

TRANSPARENCY / ALPHA
ggplot(data=mpg)+
+ geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,alpha=class))
#Using size for a discrete variable is not advised
#there are 4 class of vehicles, hard to differentiate

SHAPE
ggplot(data=mpg)+
+ geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,shape=class))
#Warning messages:
1: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more than 6
becomes difficult to discriminate; you have
7. Consider specifying shapes manually ifyou must have them. 
2: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (geom_point). 

CHANGE COLOR of ENTIRE PLOT
#To set an aesthetic manually, set the aesthetic by name as an argument of your geom function; i.e. it goes outside of aes()

#change all plots to blue
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy),color="BLUE")

#change all plots to shape no .5
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy),shape=5)

#change all plots to shape no .5 and color blue
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy),shape=5, color="blue")

3.3.1 Exercises

#What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
##   ggplot(data = mpg) + 
##   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
the default color for all plots are red, labelled as "blue" instead

correction should be ( it should be outside the aes() bracket)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
 
#Which variables in mpg are categorical? 
Which variables are continuous? 
(Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). 
How can you see this information when you run mpg?

# Categorical:model, year, trans, drv, fl,class
# Continuous:displ, cyl, cty, hwy

#Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. 
#How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

COLOR
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=hwy,y=cyl, color=hwy))
#the legend for this plot is a shade of color
#for categorical variable, the color is not a range

SIZE
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=hwy,y=cyl, size=hwy))
#the plot size increased for higher hwy value
#for categorical variable, Warning message: Using size for a discrete variable is not advised. 

SHAPE
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=hwy,y=cyl, shape=hwy))
#Error: A continuous variable can not be mapped to shape
#for categorical variable, The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more than 6 becomes
difficult to discriminate; you have 7

#What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?
ggplot(data=mpg)+
+ geom_point(mapping=aes(x=hwy,y=cyl, color=class, shape=class))
#mixture of color and shape
#Warning messages:
1: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more than 6 becomes
difficult to discriminate; you have 7. Consider specifying shapes manually if you must have them. 
2: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (geom_point). 

#What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)
ggplot(data=mpg)+
+ geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, stroke=hwy))
# The stroke aesthetic seems to adjust the plotted object thickness.

What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ < 5)? 
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, colour= displ <5))
the displ will differentiate before and after 5

3.5 Facets

FACET_WRAP
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy))+
facet_wrap(~class, nrow=2)
#To facet your plot by a single variable, use facet_wrap(). 
The first argument of facet_wrap() should be a formula, 
which you create with ~ followed by a variable name 
(here “formula” is the name of a data structure in R, not a synonym for “equation”).

FACET_GRID
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy))+
facet_grid(drv~cyl)

ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy))+
facet_grid(.~cyl)

3.5.1 Exercises

#What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy))+
facet_grid(.~displ)
#there are many grids created, each continuour variable has a grid

#What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot?
ggplot(data=mpg)+
+ geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy))+
+ facet_grid(drv~cyl)
The facets are empty when there is no data for the according combination 
e.g. rear wheel drive (r) with 4 or 5 cylinder is not listed. The 7 cylinder factes are missed entirely.
